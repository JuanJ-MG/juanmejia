## Overview

This project develops a **multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) framework**
to compare **additive manufacturing (AM)** and **traditional manufacturing (TM)**
under cost, time, and uncertainty constraints.

The work focuses on **aerospace spare parts production**, explicitly modeling:
- economies of scale,
- production lead times,
- and stochastic variability in demand, costs, and processing times.

## Key contributions

- Multi-objective MILP (cost–time tradeoff via ε-constraint)
- Incremental and bulk discount cost structures
- Monte Carlo simulation (50,000 runs)
- Risk analysis using exceedance curves
- Aerospace manufacturing case study (aileron bellcrank)

## Methods

- Gurobi optimization
- Piecewise-linear and binary-bracket formulations
- Pareto frontier analysis
- Probabilistic exceedance curves for risk-aware decisions
