## Overview

This project was developed for the **AIAA Space Systems Design Competition**, where our team earned **third place in 2021**, marking the **first participation of a Colombian team** in this international competition.

The proposed mission focused on a **Mars ice-core sample return architecture**, addressing system feasibility, mission operations, and interdisciplinary integration under realistic mission constraints.

I served as **co-leader of the team**, contributing both to **technical design and mission-level coordination**.

---

## My Role

- Co-leader responsible for **team management, coordination, and system integration**
- Oversaw alignment between mission objectives, subsystem design, and project milestones
- Ensured interface consistency and traceability across subsystems

---

## Technical Contributions

My contributions spanned multiple subsystems, including:

- **Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV)**
  - Propulsion architecture selection
  - Mass, performance, and GNC trade studies

- **Earth Reentry Capsule**
  - Aerodynamic configuration
  - Thermal Protection System (TPS) trade studies
  - Atmospheric reentry survivability analysis

- **Thermal Control System**
  - Passive and active thermal strategies
  - Thermal survivability during Mars surface operations
  - Reentry thermal constraints

- **Mars Surface and Mission Operations**
  - Definition of surface operation timelines
  - Sample acquisition and handling concept
  - Operational sequencing from landing through ascent
  - Coordination between surface, ascent, and return phases

## Outcomes

- 🏆 **3rd place – 2021 AIAA Space Systems Design Competition**
- 📄 Results published in an **AIAA journal**
- 🎤 Invited speaker at the **AIAA ASCEND Congress**, presenting mission architecture and design outcomes
- 📘 Comprehensive mission design report covering:
  - Orbital mechanics
  - Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL)
  - Mars surface operations
  - Mars ascent and sample return
  - Risk, cost, and reliability analyses
