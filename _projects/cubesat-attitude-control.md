## Overview

This project was developed as a **final project for graduate-level Aerospace Control Systems and Aerospace Systems courses**.  
The goal was to design and implement a **CubeSat command and data handling (C&DH) architecture** capable of stabilizing and controlling spacecraft attitude using **reaction wheels**.

The work emphasizes **embedded control implementation and aerospace systems integration**, bridging control theory and real-time execution.

---

## System Description

The implemented system includes:

- Microcontroller-based C&DH architecture (ESP32)
- Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for attitude sensing
- Reaction wheels for attitude actuation
- Real-time attitude estimation and feedback control
- Web-based interface for commanding and monitoring system behavior

---

## Control Approach

- Attitude estimation using inertial sensor data
- Closed-loop feedback control for attitude stabilization
- Mapping of desired body torques to reaction wheel commands
- Real-time implementation with embedded timing and actuator constraints

---

## Software and Tools

- **Embedded platform:** ESP32
- **Languages:** C/C++, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Control implementation:** Real-time embedded control loops
- **Interface:** Web-based command and visualization dashboard

## Conference Paper

A paper based on this project was accepted and presented at a **university-hosted engineering conference (CODEAC) in 2023**.  
The paper focuses on the system architecture, control approach, and experimental results from the implemented CubeSat platform.

## Notes

This work is presented as an **academic engineering course project** with a related conference paper and is not positioned as a primary research contribution.
