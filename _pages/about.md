Hi — I'm **Juan Mejia**.

I’m an **Industrial Engineer** in aircraft manufacturing (cabins) at **Textron Aviation** in Wichita, Kansas, with a background in **Aerospace Engineering** and an **M.S. in Industrial & Systems Engineering**. My work and research interests sit at the intersection of:

- Manufacturing systems & process improvement
- Optimization (MILP, multi-objective, stochastic/robust)
- Supply chain resilience and additive manufacturing

---

## Projects

A few things I work on (more in the **Projects** tab):

- Additive vs. traditional manufacturing strategy under uncertainty (optimization + simulation)
- Production / operations improvement projects in aircraft manufacturing
- Tools in Python for modeling, analysis, and decision support
